Greg confidently walked towards the battlefield with his head held high. For today was the day he would prove himself to his commanding officer and get promoted to sergeant. As he glanced around the field, his eyes filled with the sight of his squad members paired up and entangled in a passionate embrace. For after the legendary tale of Herb and James’ unquenching love, men began enlisting in the army to find love. Greg, on the other hand, had a different goal in mind, for his single motivation was to honor his country. As he walked up to his station -rifle in hand and arms held steady, his eyes fell upon the most interesting figure. On the opposing side was a tall ,robust man staring back at him, with his rifle aimed right at him. Sweat dripped down his forehead and made its way down his cheek, his hands began to shake and his aim was unsteady. He knew he had to collect himself while his commanding officer was observing. He couldn’t keep his eyes off of him and neither could the mysterious man. The man let out a small grin and Greg froze. He allowed himself to form a small grin to give back to him.
