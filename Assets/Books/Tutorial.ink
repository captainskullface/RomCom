The Boss
Welcome to your new job!
Welcome to the ^ team, Publishing Pal Number 5! That's right: you're the 5th! Hope you make it longer than the 4th. You better. We don't pay you to suck at your job oh wait my assistant is telling me we dont pay you ok disregard that part ~Anyways! You'll start off with a simple job. You're gonna be picking what books we publish. Don't worry- it only determines our company's entire profit margin and success in the future! ~You have access to a company email where authors send bits and pieces of their books to pitch them to us. Obviously I don't have time to read them all. So you're either gonna forward them to my assistant or stick em' straight in the trash- your call.~~Whenever you publish a book, you get to pick the target audience for marketing. Make sure to keep an eye on the buzz the book gets to see how well you marketed it. You can't really do anything to a book after release, but it's a good thing to know for the next one.~~All of us at ^ are putting our faith in you! ~I'll follow up with you soon. Later! ~Big Boss
