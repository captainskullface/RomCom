There Are A Lot of Cats in These Woods and They Don't Like Each Other
So i am NOT a furry I repeat NOT i just think being a cat that fights other cats is cool. i did make a cat that has a forbidden love and becomes the all powerful leader purr
You may think there's nothing going on in those woods. but you are WRONG. at night the felines come out. they are covered in battle scars and mange. they are hungry. they think the other group of cats are stinky and rude. and so they FIGHT with tooth and claw and then die of infection or rats or falling rocks. one day, the savior approaches...he is a shy yet confident yet honest yet charming yet vulnerable rather handsome for a cat cat. and everyone totally falls in love with him but the one he wants back is FORBIDDEN because her group is not part of his cat group. what will he do?? rise up in the ranks of the other housecats and inherit weird and unexplained powers or leave his group for true love?
