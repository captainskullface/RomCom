They Can't Make Love At Night Due To [Undisclosed Reasons]!
its exactly what the title said (the undisclosed reasons will be disclosed though)
ok so hear me out. there is a girl and a vampire and a werewolf (the vampire and werewolf go CRAZY at night). the girl is like mid at best and she is like emo and depressed and the vampire and werewolf are like “i can fix her” so they like get in a fight and they hate each other but in a homo way so then they start to work together after they fall in love and decide to romance the girl together but when she asks them to go on a date to dinner theyre both like “ummmmmmmmm we cant due to undisclosed reasons” and its a mystery and so itll be like really complex and deep and emotional and like really sexy and eventually they will make love at night but that will be at the end
