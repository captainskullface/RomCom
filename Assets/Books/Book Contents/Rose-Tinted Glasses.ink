Cute metalhead love story :)
Hello! Thank you for considering my book. This is heavily inspired by my own experiences as a rowdy teen. If you'd like, I can give you some music recs to listen to while you imagine the world. Enjoy this synopsis. Excited to hear from you!
It’s 1989– bright tracksuits and shoulder pads everywhere. Amber-Rose, a metalhead teen that goes by AR for short, is feeling left out of the fun. Her fondness for the louder things in life have always put a wall between her and the conservative community she lives in. No one has ever shown interest in AR– which is all good by her, she's not interested in pleasing anyone but herself. But even the cool girls get a little insecure. ~When no one shows up to her latest basement concert, AR finds herself doubting who she is. In a last ditch effort to get a hot date before graduation she trades hairmetal for glamrock and gets dressed to the nineteen eighty-nines. Her new look isn’t her at all– and no one can recognize her. Boys are swarming her with attention she’s never had. But she knows deep down that it isn’t her. Is it possible for a metalhead to fall in love? Will the one boy she’s had her eyes on notice her when she wipes off her makeup? Only AR can figure it out in this classic 80s romance.
