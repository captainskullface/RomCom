My Big Fat American Boyfriend
Myles Esquerra
Enough romance to share with everyone!
Heya. Here's my idea for a brand new franchise endeavor. We can start with the novel format and see where it goes from there. I think this has some big potential.
When Ella met Oscar Terrell, her life changed in a big way. Ella Larson, a true rags-to-riches Londoner, fought her way to the top of the world. After two battles with cancer, a rocky unplanned pregnancy, and a messy divorce, she still managed to rise into the posh society of her home city. But none of the challenges that Ella faced could have prepared her for the judgemental eye of London's elite. ~On a business trip to America, she meets Oscar and is swept into a whirlwind romance like no other. They elope in the back of a cab on the streets of New York City and Oscar trades the sparkling lights of the city for a charming England life. When the newlyweds return to London, though, whispers begin to follow Ella and her husband everywhereâ€“ she married an American?!? Follow Ella and Oscar as they fight against the stigma and stereotypes that Londonites pin on their backs and prove that a big fat American boy can do it better.
