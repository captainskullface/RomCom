So hot and amazing and pretty and amazing and FUCK","\n","^Another late night as Holly works on company reports under a single desk light. The money is good but her bosses are shits who push lots of work on the new girl. She can’t lose the job, so she puts on a brave face and takes the workload. As a tired haze hits her eyes and the bright lights of her computer become so blinding she can’t even focus, Holly snaps back to reality as she hears the clinking of a mug next to her. Just as she tries to see what the noise was, soft, slender fingers let go of a mug next to her. Holly only sees a beautiful figure with smooth black hair walk away, She can’t help but examine every part of the mysterious person. The figure stops, turns her head to Holly, and winks. Holly blushes, looking away in shame and to her newly placed cup of coffee. On the rim of the mug, she sees a mark of deep red lipstick. ~“She drank some…” ~Holly considers placing her lips on the mark, but the idea makes her head flush with color. Finally, she takes a sip. It’s smooth and sweet.","\n","^7","\n","^3","\n","^0","\n","^1","\n","^3","\n",["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
