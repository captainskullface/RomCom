Domma Natricks
Open me.
Glad to hear that the last book did well. Here is the sequel. It is good.
Now that Kean and Dom are official, their relationship has been a bit slow– the fun of a whirlwind romance wore down. They still love each other but have both agreed that something needs to give. Enter: the polyamorous Sebastian Sanders. One night at a bar together, Kean and Dom lay eyes on a flirty new prospect. They learn that he works at a local sandwich shop right across from where Kean used to work. With this new information, the courting begins. ~Will Dom and Kean’s relationship stay strong? Will they be able to romance Sebastian together? Will it all end in a steamy finale? Only the Dom will decide.
