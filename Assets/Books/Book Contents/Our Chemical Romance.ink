I LOVE AMERICAN ROCK BAND MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE
Ok so here's the thing about the New Jersey-based rock band My Chemical Romance. I like them. So I will write 11,453,543 word self insert fiction about them and youre gonna read it
“THIS SONG IS ABOUT SUCKING DICK FOR COCAINE!” ~Lights go down. The curtain falls. Onto the stage steps… the secret fifth member of My Chemical Romance? With a ghastly glow and uncannily sharp incisors, Y/N storms the stage with bleeding rhythm sections. The rest of the band has been adopting a similar look. Almost eerily, the boys seem to be looking more and more youthful by the day. As the media catches up with everyone’s favorite emo band, they start to suspect something a little more supernatural is going on beneath the surface. Y/N is spotted on wistful romantic endeavors with each of the other members of the band– and soon after is when they start to get a sparkling glow in their skin. Is there a logical explanation for this? Or is there a vampire loose in New Jersey?
