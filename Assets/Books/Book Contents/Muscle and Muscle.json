I hope you enjoy our story","\n","^Chad Chadingtus the Third, a roided slab of meat if you have ever seen one, is what one could call an alpha male: never respecting women, never washing his ass (cause it’s gay), never drinking lemonade or wearing glasses– only made up of alpha attributes. When Chad hears that the local gym has a new member, his first instinct is to haze this beta male so that he knows Chad is the leader of the pack here. But when Chad meets Tory Sunderland, the first things Chad notices are Troy’s beautiful eyes, his cute dimples, his slender fingers. What are these feelings? Follow Chad and Troy as they work together to deconstruct the ideas of toxic masculinity, the ideas of an “alpha male” and what it truly means to be a happy man.","\n","^3","\n","^4","\n","^0","\n","^2","\n","^1","\n",["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
