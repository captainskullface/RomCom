One in the Hole

Proposal for romance novel publishing
Dear Whom it may concern, I humbly ask you consider my publishing my book. It is a romantic novel between two golfers realizing their true for each other while battling the internalized homophobia they had to grow up with. I assure you, it has a beautiful ending as this is inspired by my relationship with my husband who I now have been with for 10 years now after meeting him at the golf club. Thank you, Herman Pinch
Craig Stevenson, father of 3 lovely children and husband to a wonderful wife whom he cares dearly for and sees as his best friend, is a frequent member of the Mortimer Mus ClubHouse. While he loves his family, it’s always nice to spend time with his friends away from home, cracking a cold one and swing clubs in the club’s golf course. ~Something always nagged Craig, he knows he loves his wife, or… thinks he loves his wife. He was never sure, he did what he believed was love. He would care for her, take her to dinner, love her dearly but a part of Craig felt that love wasn’t what most people would consider love to be. Not until a new member joins the club, moving all the way from exotic Europe. Slyvester Ponty, quiet, reserved, and mysterious. However, the most important thing was that Craig couldn’t stop thinking about him, with a strange feeling he only felt in the boys locker room back in school. ~But these aren’t right, these are wrong… right?
