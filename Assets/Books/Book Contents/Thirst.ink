Closed off artist meets goth (who is also a vampire and gay)
Hi, this book comes from a deep place in my heart, which is a pit of darkness known only as neverending love. I hope you enjoy this story as I learn to be vunerable once more.
What is art but the exploration of the self in a manner that leaves you vulnerable and exposed. Romana Suzuki, reserved and cold, keeps to her in the art room of her college. It’s safe… secure… alone. To be vulnerable is to be weak. While one may believe this prevented Romana from making Art, this was false as she excelled in her class, always winning awards and always on top. ~Until a mysterious woman starts appearing in the art room, watching Romona paint. She’s strange, paler than Romona, even more mysterious but… she was beautiful. Hours passed without the woman saying a word to Romona until suddenly, she approached as Romona worked and said “I don’t see you in this, that’s a shame” and walked away. ~And just like that, she had Romona’s heart
