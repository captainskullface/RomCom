Tales of the Aetherium 
Andromeda Slone
A beautiful story of obession and love
Hi! This is my first book, I love Loot Gas Giant but one ever expanded on its amazing world, so I wanted to do that and give back to the community. This story has a lot of potential and I hope you enjoy it!
Based on a unique reimaging of Loot Gas Giant, we explore the Aetherium with the hearty crew of the Sundancer. Experience bloody battles, tense conversations–steamy conversation between lovers–and more in this unique multifaceted Sci-Fi anthology. ~Follow Captain Hawke in a brutal duel, experience the journal of a lost sailor, watch two lovers understand each other more. We follow the crew try to find the mythical treasure of Johanna’s trove. Will Hawke be able to find the treasure before she loses herself and her crew? All this and more in Tales of the Aetherium.
