Ok so update
Ummmm so as it turns out. There were legal complications. But here is the other thing. My book was inspired by true events and I am the Elle Woods of this universe and I have my own crime syndicate and I control the judicial system so don't even worry about it. I already paid off your boss. Keep this between us. much love
