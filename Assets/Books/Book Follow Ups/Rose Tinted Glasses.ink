Shirley Deep
Rock on!
Hey love, ~I'm so happy that we can work together. It means a lot to me. Rose-Tinted is really a personal story and I'm happy to see it hitting the shelves soon. Hopefully you get the chance to read it! As a treat, I included that playlist I mentioned at the start of the book.
