{"inkVersion":20,"root":[["^Salem Crow","\n","^Goths Win Again","\n","^Okay, I'll be honest, with the amount of gay goth vampire there are, I wasn't expecting the book to be this succesful. I guess people will always thirst for vampires, and I can't blame them. I plan on writing more things soon. I don't know. Maybe. I still am recovering from being vulunerable and exposing my art and mind to the world. This kind of receiption is kind of scary. Becoming a celebrity overnight when you were just writing a passion project for yourself and a group of people that you feel would enjoy it. I'm terrified. Everyone wants fame and money but, this fame is constricting the air out of me. I'm worried that I'm obligated to surpass myself in ways that I don't think are even possible. I'm sorry I don't know why I'm saying all of this. Thanks again for publishing. Take care","\n",["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
