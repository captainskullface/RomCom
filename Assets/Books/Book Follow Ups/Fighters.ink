Thank you, but goodbye for now
Thank you so much for publishing Fighters ^. It fills my heart with joy everytime I see it on the shelf at the airport. I however will be taking my leave from writing for a while. I have been bullied off of Screecher for being a furry (despite not being one), and need some time to myself.~Thanks again!
